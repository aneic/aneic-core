Ancient Near-East Ivory Clustering
--

This code performs maximum likelihood and maximum posterior clustering on a corpus of Levantine ivory statuettes.

Data may be read from a CSV file. Each row is interpreted as a
separate observation. Numerical columns are assumed to be real-valued, string-valued columns are assumed to be categorical.

For a mathematical description of the algorith see the docs/ directory.
